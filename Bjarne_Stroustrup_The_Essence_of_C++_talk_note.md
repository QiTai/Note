### Pointer Misuse ###
```cpp
void f(int n, int x) {
	Gadget* p = new Gadget{n}; 							// look I'm a java programmer!
	//...
	if (x < 100) throw std::runtime_error{"Weird!"};	// leak
	if (x < 200) return;								// leak
	//...
	delete p;											// I want my garbage collector
}
```
 + garbage collection would not release non-memory resources

### Resource Handles and Pointers ###
+ A `std::shared_ptr` releases its object at when the last shared_ptr to it is destoryed
```cpp
void f(int n, int x) {
	auto p = make_shared<Gadget>(n);					// manage that pointer!
	//...
	if (x < 100) throw std::runtime_error{"Wierd!"};	// no leak
	if (x < 200) return; 								// no leak
	//...
}
```
+ `shared_ptr` provides a form of garbage collection
	* But I'm not sharing anything!


+ A `std::unique_ptr` releases its object at when it goes out of scope
```cpp
void f(int n, int x) {
	auto p = make_unique<Gadget>(n);
	//...
	if (x < 100) throw std::runtime_error("Wierd!");
	if (x < 200) return;
	//...
}
```
+ This is simple and cheap
	* No more expensive than a "plain old pointer"


+ But why use a pointer at all?
	* if you can, just use a scoped variable
```cpp
void f(int n, int x) {
	Gadget g{n};
	//...
	if (x < 100) throw std::runtime_error{"Weird!"};
	if (x < 200) return;
	//...
}
```
+ No explicit resource management
	* Code not littered with (easy to forget) try-catch
	* No spurious allocations/deallocations
	* No pointers

### Error Handling and Resources ###
+ "Resource Acquisition is Initialization" (RAII)
	* Acquire during construction
	* Release in destructor
+ Throw Exception in case of failure
	* In particular, throw is a constructor cannot construct and object
+ Never throw while holding a resource not owned by a handle
+ In general
	* Leave established invariants intact when leaving a scope


### Why do we use pointers? ###
+ references, iterators, etc

+ To represent ownership
	* **Don't! Stop!** Instead, use handles
+ To reference resources
	* from within a handle
+ To represent positions
	* Be careful
+ To pass large amounts of data(into a function)
	* pass by const reference
+ To return large amount of data(out of a function)
	* **Don't!** Instead use move operations.


### How to get a lot of data cheaply out of a function? ###
+ Consider 
	* factory functions
	* functions returning lots of objects
+ Return a pointer to a **new**'d object?
```cpp
M* operator+(const M&, const M&);
M* pm = m1 + m2;	// ugly: and who does the delete;
M* q  = *pm + m3;	// ugly: and who does the delete;
```
+ Return a reference to a **new**'d object?
```cpp
M& operator+(const M&, const M&);
M m = m1 + m2;		// looksã€€OK: but who does the delete? Delete what?
```
+ Pass a target object?
```cpp
void operator+(const M&, const M&, M& res);
M m;
operator+(m1, m2, m);	// ugly: We are regressing towards assembly code
```
+ Return an object!
	* `M operator+(const M&, const M&)`
	* How?
		+ Copies are expensive
	* Tricks to avoid copying are brittle
	* Tricks to avoid copying are not general
+ **Return a handle**
	* Simple and cheap!

### Move Semantics ###
+ Return a Matrix
```cpp
Matrix operator+(const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b) {
	Matrix r;
	// copy a[i] + b[i] into r[i] for each i
	return r;
} 
Matrix res = a + b;
```
+ Define move a construtor for Matrix
	+ don't copy, "steal the representation"

+ Direct support in C++ 11: **Move Constructor** *To devel into* --->
```cpp
class Matrix {
	Representation rep;
	//...
	Matrix(Matrix&& a) {		// move constructor
		rep = a.rep;		// *this gets a's element
		a.rep = { }		// a becomes the empty Matrix
	}
};
Matrix res = a + b;
```

+ Often, you can avoid writing copy and move operations	
	* Easily avoid
```cpp
class Matrix {
	vector<double> elem; 	// elements here
	//... matrix access ...
};
```

+ Matrix just "inherit" resource management from vector
+ Copy and a move operations can often be implicitly generate from members
	* Good copy and move operations
	* from the standard library

### Garbage Collection ###
+ GC is neither general nor ideal
+ Apply these techniques in order:
	* Store data in containers
		+ The semantics of the fundemental abstraction is reflected in the interface
	* Manage all resources with resource handles
		+ RAII
		+ Not just memory: all resources
	* Use "Smart pointers"
		+ But they are still pointers
	* Plug in a garbage collector
		+ For "litter collection"
		+ C++11 specifies a GC interface
		+ Can still leak non-memory resources


### Range-for, auto, and move ###
+ As ever, what matters is how features work in combination
```cpp
template<typename C, typename V>
vector<Value_type<C>* > find_all(C& c, V v) 	//find all occurrences of v in c
{
	vector<Value_type<C>*> res;
	for (auto& x : c)
		if (x == v)
			res.push_back(&x);
	return res;
}

string m{"Mary had a little lamb"};
for (const auto p : find_all(m, 'a')) 		// p is a char*
	if (*p != 'a')
		cerr << "string bug!\n";
```		

### OOP/Inheritance ###
+ carries cost
	* Indirect function calls (virtual functions)
		+ ~25% overhead over ordinary function calls
		+ Worse: doesn't inline well
	* Objects must be on the free store (in dynamic memory) 
		+ Allocation / deallocation
		+ Indirect access to objects
		+ Memory management of those objects
			* Not Hard: Use unique_ptr, shared_ptr, or owning containers
		+ Great coupling between program parts
		+ Designing good interfaces (base classes) requires foresight
+ Inheritance is seriously and systematically overused and misused


### Generic Programming: Templates###
+ 1980 Use Macros to express generic types and functions
+ 1987 (and current) aims:
	* Extremely general/flexible
	* Zero-overhead
		+ vector/Matrix/...to compete with C arrays
	* Well-specified interface
		+ Implying overheading, good error messages, and maybe seperate compilation
+ "two out of three ain't bad" (The first two)
	* But it isn't really good either
	* kept Bjarne Stroustrup working for 20+ years
### Templates ###
+ A massive success in C++98, better in C++11, better still in C++14
	* STL containers
	```cpp
	template<typename T> class vector{ };
	```
	* STL alg.
		`sort(v.begin(), v.end());`
	* Much More
+ Compile-time duck typing
	* Leading to template metaprogramming


### Algorithm and Function Objects###
```cpp
void g(vector<string> &vs) {
	auto p = find_if(vs.begin(), vs.end(), Less_than{"Griffin"});
}
```
+ General function object
	* can carry state
	* easily inlined(close to optimally efficient)
```cpp
struct Less_than {
	string s;
	Less_than(const string& ss) : s{ss} { }
	bool operator()(const string& v) const { return v < s;}
};
```
+ Lambda notation
	* we can let the compiler write the function object for us
	```cpp
	auto p = find_if(vs.begin(), vs.end(), [](const string& v) { return v < "Griffin"; } );
	```
+ The implementation is trivial
```cpp
template<typename Iter, typename Predicate>
Iter find_if(Iter first, Iter last, Predicate pred) { 
// find first p in [first:last) so that pred(*p) 
	while (first != last && !pred(*first))
		++first;
	return first;
}
```
### Container algorithm ###
+ Applying an alg. to a half-open sequence [b:e) is general
+ The C++ standard offers algorithms on [b:e)
```cpp
template<typename Seq, typename Pred>
void sort(Seq& s, Pred p) {
	std::sort(begin(s), end(s), p);
}
```

### C++14 Concepts *To devel into*---->
+ Duck typing isn't good enough
+ We need better-specified interfaces to templates
	* State intent
	* Specify requirements for template arguments
+ A concept is a predicate on a set of types and values
```cpp
template<typename Cont>
requires Sortable<Cont>()	// Sortable is a Sequence with random access
void sort(Cont& container);
```
+ We can say
```cpp
void sort(Sortable& c);
```
+ It means
```cpp
template<Sortable __S>
void sort(__S &c);
```
+ Which means
```cpp
template<typename __S>
	require Sortable<__S>()
void sort(__S & c);
```
+ Useful for lambdas
```cpp
[](Sortable& c){ sort(begin(c), end(c)); }
```

# Error handling is simple (and fast)
```cpp
template<Sortable Cont> 	// Sortable is a sequence with random access
void sort(Cont& container);

vector<double> vec{1.2, 3.4, 0.5, -1.2};
list<int> lst{1, 3, 4, 5};

sort(vec);	//OK: a vector is Sortable
sort(lst); 	//Error at (this) point of use: Sortable requires random access
```

+ **Actual** error message
	* error:'list<int>' doesn't satisfy the constraint 'Sortable'
+ Additional information upon request
